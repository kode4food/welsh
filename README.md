# Welsh (Promises, but not really) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kode4food/welsh.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kode4food/welsh)

Welsh is a lightweight Promises library that supports [A+ Promises](https://promisesaplus.com/) and Deferreds Ã  la [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html).

The main differences between Deferreds and Promises revolve around internal state and mutability.

Calling a Deferred's `then()` method will add callbacks to the internal dispatch chain of the Deferred and return the same instance.  Also, the internal state of a Deferred will mutate as it transitions between steps of the chain.

On the other hand, Promises are completely independent and, once fulfilled, immutable.  Each call to a Promise's `then()` method will produce a new Promise instance that depends on the parent's eventually fulfilled value.

Use a Deferred if you want to build a fast, isolated, and synchronous dispatch chain that still honors 'Thenable' results.  Use a Promise when you need to create multiple branches of intermediate results or you need to pass the Promise into code that you don't control.

Here's how you use it.  First, npm install it:

```bash
npm install welsh --save
```

Then, write code:

```javascript
var deferred = require('welsh').deferred;

deferred(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("Bill");
}).then(function (result) {
  return 'Hello, ' + result + '!';
}).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

Of course, the Functions in your chain can also return Welsh Deferreds.  You can also call reject() and do the whole onFulfilled, onRejected thing when you add functions to the chain.  Just check the code in `test/*.js` to see what I mean.

If you want to create a Promise, you might do:

```javascript
var promise = require('welsh').promise;

promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("Bill");
}).then(function (result) {
  return 'Hello, ' + result + '!';
}).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

Yeah, the code is basically identical.  That's the point!

You can also install the library with Bower using `bower install welsh`.  Though honestly, I haven't tested it and don't plan to.  I'd love pull requests though!
