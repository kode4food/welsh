Welsh is a lightweight Promises library that supports [A+ Promises](https://promisesaplus.com/) and Deferreds Ã  la [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html).

Here's how you use it.  First, npm install it:

```bash
npm install welsh --save
```

or install it using Bower with:

```bash
bower install welsh --save
```

Then, write code.  This will create a Promise:

```javascript
var promise = require('welsh').promise;

promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("Bill");
}).then(function (result) {
  return 'Hello, ' + result + '!';
}).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

while this will create a Deferred:

```javascript
var deferred = require('welsh').deferred;

deferred(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("Bill");
}).then(function (result) {
  return 'Hello, ' + result + '!';
}).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

Yeah, the code is basically identical.  That's the point!

## Promises versus Deferreds
The main differences between Promises and Deferreds revolve around internal state and mutability.

Promises are completely independent and, once fulfilled, immutable.  Each call to a Promise's `then()` method will produce a brand new Promise instance that depends on its parent's eventually fulfilled value.

On the other hand, calling a Deferred's `then()` method will add callbacks to the internal dispatch chain of the Deferred and return the same instance.  Also, the internal state of a Deferred will mutate as it transitions between steps of the chain.

## Here's Where It Gets Interesting
Promises operate under the assumption that they'll be passed around to different parts of your code, that the chains will branch, and that the code they're calling will always result in an asynchronous result.

But what are you doing most of the time with Promises?  You're usually creating a long, single-statement chain of `then()` calls that transform intermediate results, often synchronously.  As a result, you've now inherited a significant amount of unnecessary overhead.  So what is the solution?  Deferreds!

Start off with a Deferred when you need close to bare-metal performance, and then generate a promise using `toPromise()` when you need to pass the result around. You can even use `toDeferred()` to convert a Promise back to a Deferred.

```javascript
return deferred(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("Bill");
}).then(function (result) {
  return 'Hello, ' + result + '!';
}).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
}).toPromise();
```

In short, use a Deferred if you want to build a fast, isolated, and synchronous dispatch chain that still honors asynchronous 'Thenable' results.  Use a Promise when you need to create multiple branches of intermediate results or you need to pass the Promise into code that you don't control.

## The Welsh API
Two (nearly) identical interfaces are exposed.  They are the `promise` and the `deferred` functions.  They are used to create a Promise or a Deferred, respectively.  Each function accepts an optional executor callback that is invoked synchronously and can be used to resolve or reject the promise or deferred that invoked it.

```javascript
var welsh = require('welsh');

welsh.promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  // call resolve(result) or reject(reason) somewhere.
  // the one that is called first will win
});

welsh.deferred(function (resolve, reject) {
  // call resolve(result) or reject(reason) somewhere.
  // the one that is called first will win
});
```

The Promise or Deferred that is returned will be an Object that contains several Function properties.  Most of these should be familiar.  They are:

`resolve(result?:any)` - Resolves the Promise or Deferred with the specified result.  This Function is only present if no executor was defined in the creation of the Promise/Deferred.

`reject(reason?:any)` - Rejects the Promise or Deferred with the specified reason.  This Function is only present if no executor was defined in the creation of the Promise/Deferred.

`then(onFulfilled?:Function, onRejected?:Function)` - In the case of a Promise, creates a Promise whose value depends on its parent. In the case of a Deferred, adds an onFulfilled and/or onRejected handler to the dispatch chain.

`catch(onRejected?:Function)` - Same as 'then' except that only an `onRejected` callback is provided.

`finally(onFinally?:Function)` - Will call the onFinally callback when the parent Promise or Deferred is either fulfilled or rejected.  Will not interrupt or modify further processing.

`toNode(function (err?:any, result?:any))` - Returns a Promise or Deferred that performs a Node-style Callback.  Will not interrupt or modify further processing.

`toPromise()` - Converts the current Promise or Deferred into a new Promise (mostly useful for Deferreds).

`toDeferred()` - Converts the current Promise or Deferred into a new Deferred.

`cancel()` (for Deferreds only) - Cancels any further callback dispatching on the Deferred.

For example:

```javascript
var p = welsh.promise().catch(function (reason) {
  console.log(reason);
}).finally(function () {
  console.log("all done!");
});

p.reject('I reject you!');
```

The `welsh.promise` and `welsh.deferred` interfaces also expose some additional capabilities in the form of helper and utility functions:

`resolve(result)` - Creates and returns an immediately resolved Promise or Deferred.

`reject(reason)` - Creates and returns an immediately rejected Promise or Deferred.

`all(...promises)` - Creates a new Promise or Deferred whose eventually fulfilled value will be an Array containing the fulfilled results of each provided Promise or Deferred.

`race(...promises)` - Creates a new Promise or Deferred whose eventually fulfilled value will be the whichver provided Promise or Deferred is resolved first.

For example:

```javascript
var p1 = welsh.promise();
var p2 = welsh.promise();
var d1 = welsh.deferred();

welsh.promise.race(p1, p2, d1).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});

d1.resolve('D1 Wins!');
```
