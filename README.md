# Welsh (Promises, but not really)

Welsh is a lightweight Promises library that supports [A+ Promises](https://promisesaplus.com/) and Deferreds Ã  la [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html).

The main difference between a Deferred and a Promise is that calling a Deferred's `then` method will modify the internal dispatch chain of the original Deferred and return the same instance, whereas `then` against a Promise will produce a completely independent Promise instance.  Use a Promise when you want isolation, use a Deferred when you don't care.

Here's how you use it.  First, npm install it:

```bash
npm install welsh --save
```

Then, write code:

```javascript
var deferred = require('welsh').deferred;

deferred(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("Bill");
}).then(function (result) {
  return 'Hello, ' + result + '!';
}).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

Of course, the Functions in your chain can also return Welsh Deferreds.  You can also call reject() and do the whole onFulfilled, onRejected thing when you add functions to the chain.  Just check the code in `test/*.js` to see what I mean.

If you want to create a Promise, you migth do:

```javascript
var promise = require('welsh').promise;

promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("Bill");
}).then(function (result) {
  return 'Hello, ' + result + '!';
}).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

Yeah, the code is basically identical.  That's the point!

You can also install the library with Bower using `bower install welsh`.  Though honestly, I haven't tested it and don't plan to.  I'd love pull requests though!
